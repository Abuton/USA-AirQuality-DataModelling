### Measuring Air Quality

Levels of various air borne pollutants such as Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (also called particle pollution) are all major contributors to the measure of overall air quality.

For instance, NO2 is measured using micrograms in each cubic metre of air (µg m3). A microgram (µg) is one millionth of a gram. A concentration of 1 µg m3 means that one cubic metre of air contains one microgram of pollutant.

To protect our health, the UK Government sets two air quality objectives for NO2 in their Air Quality Strategy

    The hourly objective, which is the concentration of NO2 in the air, averaged over a period of one hour.

    The annual objective, which is the concentration of NO2 in the air, averaged over a period of a year.

There are 18 stations (monitors):

Each line represents one reading from a specific detector. Detectors take one reading every hour. If you examine the file using a programming editor, Notepad++ can handle the job, you can see that the first row gives headers and there are another 1408379 (1.4 million+) rows (lines). There are 23 data items (columns) per line.
